Welcome to Talawa's documentation!
==================================

The Talawa mobile app is a simple project and event management tool. It is suitable not only for community organizations such as houses of worship and clubs, but also small businesses.

Events can be created in the calendar, with persons being assigned responsibilities and deadlines. There are news feed and chat features for additional community engagement.

Say for example a religious institution is planning a wedding. The event can be created, the faithful alerted, persons responsible for all aspects of the planning assigned, and registrations accepted. Talawa helps improve the management and engagement of the community.
