Maintainer Guidelines

Our maintainers follow these guidelines.

Maintainer Contributions
........................

Maintainers can merge code into the various branches.

#. This brings great responsibility and visibility. If your code, or code you approve, fails then everyone will know and will be able to revert to a previous pull request. Reviews must be thorough and must follow `Google's best practices. <https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html>`_ This includes:
    - The code is well-designed.
    - The functionality is good for the users of the code.
    - Any UI changes are sensible and look good.
    - Any parallel programming is done safely.
    - The code isn’t more complex than it needs to be.
    - The developer isn’t implementing things they might need in the future but don’t know they need now.
    - Code has appropriate unit tests.
    - Tests are well-designed.
    - The developer used clear names for everything.
    - Comments are clear and useful, and mostly explain why instead of what.
    - Code is appropriately documented (generally in g3doc).
    - The code conforms to our style guides.
#. A maintainer's modifications to the code base must be reviewed and merged by another maintainer. Maintainers have been selected for their coding ability. They must therefore comply with `Google's best practices. <https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html>`_. Because of this, the degree of review can be less exacting, and focus on:
    - Readability
    - Code style
    - Obvious flaws in the workflow
