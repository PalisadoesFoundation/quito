# Which Branch to Merge With?

This section can be deleted after reading.

We employ the following branching strategy to simplify the development process and to ensure that only stable code is pushed to the `master` branch:

- `develop`: For unstable code: New features and bug fixes.
- `alpha-x.x.x`: For stability testing: Only bug fixes accepted.
- `master`: Where the stable production ready code lies. Only security related bugs.
